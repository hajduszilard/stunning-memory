<h1>This is the main headline of the article</h1>
  <h2>This is a second level heading</h2>
    <p>Here comes the first paragraph of text that describes what this article will be about. <strong>Its second sentence is so important it gets marked additionally.</strong></p>
    <p>"Then comes a longer quotation from long ago that makes you think."</p>
    <p>In the second paragraph there is nothing interesting. But after the second paragraph there is an image of a tree.</p>
